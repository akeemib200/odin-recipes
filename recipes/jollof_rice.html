      <li>3 Medium Size Red Bell Peppers (Tatashe)</li>
      <li>1 can of Plum Tomatoes/ 3 Medium Tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 Scotch Bonnet (Ata rodo)</li>
      <li>2 Cups Beef or Chicken Stock or Water</li>
      <li>100g Tomato Paste</li>
      <li>2 Onions</li>
      <li>120ml Cooking Oil</li>
      <li>2 Tablespoons Butter</li>
      <li>1 Inch Root Ginger</li>
      <li>4 Cloves Garlic</li>
      <li>1 Teaspoon Curry Powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon seasoning or any seasons of your choosing</li>
      <li>4 knorr Chicken Cubes</li>
      <li>1 Tablespoon White Pepper</li>
      <li>1 Teaspoon Thyme</li>
      <li>2 Bay Leaves</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Wash your rice thoroughly till the water runs clean and set aside</li>
      <li>
        Blend the Red Bell Peppers, Ginger, Garlic, Scotch Bonnet, Tomatoes and
        1 Onion till smooth and set aside
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a fairly big pot on medium heat. When it's hot, add the blended
        Pepper, Curry Powder, Thyme, Seasoning, Knorr Cubes, White Pepper, Bay
        leaves and salt to taste. Mix thoroughly, leave to boil for 10-12
        minutes, stir occasionally. This step is to get rid of most of the water
        contents
      </li>
      <li>
        While that is boiling, place a Saucepan on low to medium heat, add the
        Vegetable Oil/Cooking Oil into it, when it's hot, slice 1 Onion and pour
        into the Oil. Saut√© for 2 minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        Now add the Tomato Paste, fry for 10 minutes thereabouts. It is well
        fried when the Paste loses its sourness and begins to taste really sweet
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the fried Tomato paste along with the Onions and Oil into the
        boiled Pepper mix and continue to fry for another 10-12 minutes. Stir
        every now and then
      </li>
      <li>Add 1-2 cups of stock or water and leave for a further 5 minutes</li>
      <li>Now, add the washed rice</li>
      <li>Stir thoroughly</li>
      <li>
        Now, cover the pot firmly with foil paper to trap in the heat, then
        secure tightly with the lid of the pot.
      </li>
      <li>Turn the heat up to high and leave to cook for 10-12 minutes</li>
      <li>
        Be careful not to add too much liquid into your Jollof rice, otherwise
        you'll end up with Soggy Jollof rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the rice is softened, add the sliced Onions,Tomatoes and Butter.
        Stir thoroughly. Switch the heat off and allow to simmer with the
        residual heat for a further 5 minutes
      </li>
    </ol>
