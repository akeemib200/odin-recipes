    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Get your core ingredients ready. Efo Riro is a fast cooking dish, so
        you'll need to be proactive.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the meats, add sliced onions and boil on medium heat. Remember to
        boil the tougher meats first, then add the softer ones. Just before it's
        fully cooked, add the Stockfish, boil till tender and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wash your vegetables thoroughly with hot water to rid it of all traces
        of dirt, be careful not to in soak in hot water for too long so as to
        retain the nutrients. Slice or chop according to your preference and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Blend the scotch bonnets and bell peppers and an onion coarsely and set
        aside into a large pot, add the palm oil, leave to heat up on medium
        heat for 2 minutes
      </li>
      <li>Then add onions, fry till fragrant.</li>
      <li>
        Then add the locust beans, fry to release the flavour for another minute
      </li>
      <li>
        Now add the blended pepper and two Knorr cubes, let that fry for 15-20
        minutes thereabouts or until the pepper dries out and the size reduces
        by almost half
      </li>
      <li>
        Add a bit of the meat stock/ chicken stock, if you haven't got stock,
        just add water, be careful not to add too much. Just one cup should do
      </li>
      <li>
        Let it boil for 2-3 minutes to combine, then add the assorted meats,
        prawns, crayfish, stockfish and catfish.
      </li>
      <li>Add the washed vegetables, combine thoroughly</li>
      <li>
        Switch off the heat at this time, leave to simmer for a further 5
        minutes with the residual heat and it's ready.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve with any “swallow” of your choice. Efo Riro is also prefect with
        white rice, boiled yam and plantain.
