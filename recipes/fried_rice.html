    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I love, love Coconut rice! Well, who doesn't? This Ginger Coconut Rice is
      similar to the ever popular Nigerian Fried Rice with the main difference
      being incorporation of Coconut flavour and a potent Ginger accent. You'll
      need to incorporate loads of Ginger to thoroughly enjoy this recipe.
      Follow this recipe as stated and you're bound to end up with a super
      delicious pot of Coconut Fried Rice.
